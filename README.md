# Mimo-Python-AI-Developer-Projects

This repository contains projects completed as part of the Mimo Professional Certificate in Python AI Development. The Mimo program is designed to provide a hands-on learning experience, focusing on building foundational skills in Python and advancing into artificial intelligence (AI) concepts. These projects range from simple Python scripting exercises to more advanced machine learning and data analysis applications, allowing learners to build practical experience through real-world coding challenges. Throughout the course, participants gain proficiency in Python programming, working with popular libraries such as **NumPy**, **pandas**, and **TensorFlow**, which are essential for *AI and data science applications*.

The projects in this repository serve as a comprehensive demonstration of the skills acquired during the Mimo Professional Certificate. Each project is documented, providing context on its purpose, the technologies and techniques applied, and the learning outcomes achieved. Whether it's building neural network models, analyzing datasets, or automating tasks through Python, these projects illustrate the depth of understanding and practical capabilities gained through the Mimo program. This repository is intended to showcase the learning journey and serve as a portfolio for future AI and data science opportunities.
